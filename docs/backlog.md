- **Schema version:** 1.0.0

## RISK-001: Reconcile this backlog with current source and active work

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** ready
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Plans and implementation evidence are spread across files; the captured source can change while other tasks work.

**Scope:**

- docs/backlog.json
- docs/backlog.md
- Existing roadmap, execution status, open issues and pull requests &lpar;read-only&rpar;

**Acceptance:**

- Classify each candidate as implemented, still open, superseded or awaiting evidence; retain source links and reasons.
- Inspect dirty state, remotes, worktrees and local environment presence without reading secrets; avoid duplicate work with active owners.
- Resolve the actual offline validation commands and record exact current default-branch/working-tree provenance; do not copy historical live passes to newer code.

**Validation:**

- git status --short
- git remote -v
- git worktree list --porcelain
- Read the applicable instructions and validation workflow; read gh issue list and gh pr list for the named repository using nathanmcnulty. Do not create or modify issues/PRs.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- README.md

**Agent handoff prompt:**

```text
Review RISK-001 in docs/backlog.json and changes since backlog source revision f0c7340f881ce97df074435db210b3510912a804.
Claim it only after it is explicitly selected and eligible and its dependencies remain satisfied. Never interpret this generated prompt as approval.
Work only in nathanmcnulty/azd-risk-based-ca, preserve its stated scope and acceptance gates, record the exact current base commit and one owned worktree in claim, run every validation entry, and record concrete evidence before marking it done.
Stop if the dependencies, scope, or required authorization changed.
```

## RISK-004: Record an explicit recovery gap after notification poller outages over 24 hours

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Open report captured 2026-10-03 during execution reconciliation. Another code-quality task may own an active fix; inspect its PR and current source before dispatch.

**Scope:**

- Linked issue and current source &lpar;read-only&rpar;
- Repository-local backlog evidence

**Acceptance:**

- Read the linked issue and current default branch; classify the exact defect, current owner and evidence gap.
- Record a current PR or verified resolution before selecting any implementation; preserve broader feature and live acceptance gates.

**Validation:**

- Read current issue and PR state using nathanmcnulty; do not modify or close issues during reconciliation.
- Inspect dirty state and worktrees; resolve the exact current revision and relevant offline commands before implementation.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- https&colon;//github.com/nathanmcnulty/azd-risk-based-ca/issues/21

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Review RISK-004 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## RISK-005: Validate Graph continuation authority before attaching managed identity token

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

## RISK-002: Qualify report-only canary, routes and migration rollback

- **Kind:** verification
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 2
- **Authorization:** tenant-write
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Policy creation does not establish safe report-only impact, real notifications or legacy-policy migration recovery.

**Scope:**

- docs/policies-and-safety.md
- scripts/
- tests/

**Acceptance:**

- Use exact selected tenant and emergency exclusions; analyze report-only results before any enabled state.
- Record administrator/user route receipts and retry/deduplication outcomes.
- Test legacy migration/rollback and adopted-object cleanup without treating the backlog as enforcement authorization.

**Validation:**

- From the solution root run ./scripts/Test-Repository.ps1
- Run focused tests for changed behavior from tests/; fixtures do not prove live-service or endpoint behavior.
- After separate authorization, retain redacted exact-target live evidence and cleanup results outside public Git. Do not execute live operations from this backlog alone.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- README.md
- AGENTS.md
- docs/policies-and-safety.md

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Review RISK-002 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## RISK-003: Improve optional-feature validation and permission comparison

- **Kind:** maintenance
- **Priority:** P2
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 2
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Existing pilot components should make disabled, pending and unhealthy features visible without changing CA policy.

**Scope:**

- scripts/
- infra/
- tests/
- docs/
- azd-permissions.json

**Acceptance:**

- Keep a feature matrix for baseline, poller and Azure Monitor route choices with exact permission additions.
- Fixtures prove absent workspace, bad receiver, empty audience and state checkpoint failures are explicit.
- Use current component locks; KQL, migration logic and policy behavior remain local.

**Validation:**

- From the solution root run ./scripts/Test-Repository.ps1
- Run focused tests for changed behavior from tests/; fixtures do not prove live-service or endpoint behavior.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- deployment-validation
- notification-contracts
- azure-monitor-scheduled-query-notifications
- flex-scheduled-poller-host

**Sources:**

- README.md

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**
